I will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication
plant pass quality assurance (QA). 
During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.
I have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which I can build a logistic regression model.
